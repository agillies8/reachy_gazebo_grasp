#Reachy gazebo grasp demo

This package will run an application that causes reachy to move his arm to a pose above a detected Apriltag.

It is depended on the apriltag_ros package, as well as my generated version of reachy_moveit_config. Im assuming you have this installed already as well, but you can find it here: https://github.com/AprilRobotics/apriltag_ros

##To set up:

This assumes you are running ROS Noetic and have a catkin_ws correctly set up. You also need to install Gazebo 11, as well as the ROS gazebo plugin package.

This also assumes you have moveit installed and have successfully used the demo.launch file generated by reachy_moveit_config

get the required packages into your catkin_ws:

    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/agillies8/reachy_gazebo_grasp
    git clone https://github.com/agillies8/reachy_moveit_config
    cd ..
    catkin build

##To start the demo:

    roslaunch reachy_gazebo_grasp demo1.launch

Then open the gazebo window, and add a table in front of reachy

Use the object translation tool to bring the cube on top of the table in front of reachy

If the cube is in reachys workspace, reachy will automatically start planning and executing a trajectory to the cube.
